  guiaTit: "Guide: how to use it and what it is for",
  guiaTablas: "<h3>What it is for</h3><p>When we reason, we join sentences with words such as ‘not’, ‘and’, ‘or’ or ‘if…, then’. A truth table lets you see, without making mistakes, when a compound sentence is true and when it is false. It also lets you check whether an argument is correct: whether the conclusion <em>has to</em> be true whenever the premises are.</p><h3>Before you start: swapping sentences for letters</h3><p>Each simple sentence is replaced by a letter. For example, ‘it is raining’ = <em>p</em> and ‘the ground gets wet’ = <em>q</em>. The words that join sentences are called connectives:</p><ul><li><strong>¬</strong> ‘not’: ¬p = ‘it is not raining’.</li><li><strong>∧</strong> ‘and’: p ∧ q = ‘it is raining and the ground gets wet’. It is true only if both parts are true.</li><li><strong>∨</strong> ‘or’: p ∨ q. It is true if at least one of the two is true.</li><li><strong>→</strong> ‘if…, then’: p → q = ‘if it rains, the ground gets wet’. It is false in only one case: when it rains and the ground does not get wet.</li><li><strong>↔</strong> ‘if and only if’: it is true when both parts have the same value (both T or both F).</li></ul><h3>Step by step</h3><ol><li>Click one of the examples or type your formula in the ‘Formula’ box. The symbols that are not on the keyboard have buttons below the box.</li><li>Use brackets to group, as in maths: (p ∨ q) ∧ r is not the same as p ∨ (q ∧ r).</li><li>The table builds itself as you type. Each row is one possibility, a combination of T and F for the letters: with two letters there are 4 rows; with three, 8.</li><li>Look at the last column and the message below. The formula may be a <strong>tautology</strong> (always true), a <strong>contradiction</strong> (always false) or a <strong>contingency</strong> (it depends on how the world is).</li><li>Further down, in ‘Is this argument valid?’, type the premises separated by semicolons, then the conclusion, and click ‘Check’. If there is a row with all the premises true and the conclusion false, it will appear in red. It is a <strong>counterexample</strong>: the argument is not valid.</li></ol><h3>A first test</h3><p>Among the argument examples, click ‘Affirming the consequent’: ‘if it rains, the ground gets wet; the ground is wet; therefore it is raining’. It sounds reasonable, but the table finds the counterexample: the ground can be wet because someone has watered it. Compare it with ‘Modus ponens’, which is valid.</p><p class=\"lg-nota\">Careful: an argument being valid does not mean its conclusion is true. It means that, <em>if</em> the premises are true, the conclusion is true too.</p>",
  guiaSilog: "<h3>What it is for</h3><p>Many everyday arguments talk about groups of things or people: ‘all…’, ‘no…’, ‘some…’. The syllogism is the oldest way of studying them: Aristotle invented it more than 2,300 years ago. This tool tells you whether an argument of this kind is correct and shows you with diagrams.</p><h3>The parts</h3><ul><li>A syllogism has <strong>two premises</strong> and a <strong>conclusion</strong>.</li><li>There are three terms, that is, three groups. In ‘Every human is mortal; every Athenian is human; therefore every Athenian is mortal’, <em>Athenian</em> is the subject of the conclusion (S), <em>mortal</em> is the predicate of the conclusion (P) and <em>human</em> is the middle term (M): it acts as a bridge between the other two and disappears in the conclusion.</li><li>Each sentence is one of four types: <strong>A</strong> ‘all S are P’, <strong>E</strong> ‘no S is P’, <strong>I</strong> ‘some S are P’ and <strong>O</strong> ‘some S are not P’. A trick to remember them: A and I are the vowels of <em>affirmo</em> (‘I affirm’, in Latin), and E and O those of <em>nego</em> (‘I deny’).</li></ul><h3>Step by step</h3><ol><li>Type the three terms in the singular, or leave the ones shown as an example.</li><li>In the drop-down menus, choose the type of each premise and of the conclusion.</li><li>Choose the figure: it shows where the middle term sits in each premise. If you are not sure, click one of the examples and watch how it changes.</li><li>Read the result: ‘Valid’ or ‘Not valid’. If it is not valid, it says which rule it breaks.</li><li>Look at the diagrams. Each circle is a group. In the Venn diagram, grey = empty region (there is nothing there) and ✕ = there is at least one there. In the Euler diagram, one circle inside another means ‘all’, separate circles mean ‘none’ and overlapping circles mean ‘some’. If drawing only the premises already shows what the conclusion says, the syllogism is valid.</li></ol><h3>A first test</h3><p>Type your own terms: S = cat, M = mammal, P = animal. First try AAA in figure 1 (the Barbara mood): ‘every mammal is an animal; every cat is a mammal; therefore every cat is an animal’. Then change the minor premise to ‘Some…’ and see what happens to the conclusion. And a challenge: find a syllogism with true premises and a true conclusion that is still not valid.</p>",
  guiaPuertas: "<h3>What it is for</h3><p>Phones and computers do not ‘think’: they carry out millions of very simple logical operations every second. Each of those operations is done by a logic gate, a tiny circuit. This tab shows that the logic of truth tables is the same logic that makes computers work: you just swap T for 1 (current flows) and F for 0 (current does not flow).</p><h3>Step by step</h3><ol><li>Choose a gate with the buttons at the top (NOT, AND, OR…). Below, it shows what the gate does and which connective from the truth tables it matches.</li><li>Click the inputs to switch them between 0 and 1, and see whether the output lights up. The gate’s table sums up all the possible cases.</li><li>In ‘The formula as a circuit’, type a formula, just as in the truth tables, and it will appear drawn as a circuit of gates. Click the letters to change their value: powered wires carry a 1, and the lamp at the end is the result.</li><li>If you come from the ‘Truth tables’ tab, the ‘See as a circuit’ button brings the formula you were using here.</li></ol><h3>A first test</h3><p>Think of a hallway light with a switch at each end: whichever one you press, the light changes. Which gate does that? Try XOR. And another: an alarm that sounds if the front door is open <em>and</em> the alarm is switched on. Which gate is it?</p><p class=\"lg-nota\">Fun fact: with a single type of gate, NAND, repeated many times, you can build any circuit, including an entire computer.</p>",
  guiaParad: "<h3>What it is for</h3><p>A paradox is not a trick riddle or a strange sentence: it is a problem that forces you to think better. It starts from things that almost all of us would accept and, step by step, arrives at something absurd. Some paradoxes were resolved and taught us something new; for example, that the sum of infinitely many numbers can have a finite result. Others are still debated today.</p><h3>How to use the cards</h3><ol><li>Use the ‘Show’ drop-down menu to see a single group, or leave it on ‘All’.</li><li>Read the title, the origin (who raised it and when) and the statement in the box.</li><li>Before opening anything, <strong>try to say for yourself where the problem lies</strong>: which step seems doubtful to you? Which premise would you deny?</li><li>Open ‘Where is the problem?’ and compare it with what you had thought. On some cards there is a button to see the paradox in the truth table.</li><li>Open ‘Solutions that have been proposed’: these are the answers of different philosophers. You do not have to settle for the first one; sometimes they contradict each other.</li><li>Finish with ‘Food for thought’, which brings the paradox to a familiar case.</li></ol><h3>One way of working in class</h3><p>In pairs: one person defends the view that the reasoning is correct and the other looks for the faulty step. Then they swap roles. To start with, ‘The Liar’, ‘Achilles and the Tortoise’ or ‘The Ship of Theseus’ work well.</p>",
  guiaEjerc: "<h3>What it is for</h3><p>There are no paradoxes here: just ordinary sentences, like the ones we read in a text or say in an argument. Analysing them helps you understand exactly what they claim, what they take for granted and, above all, what they do <em>not</em> say even though it may seem they do. That is what you need to comment on a text without attributing to it things it does not say.</p><h3>Step by step</h3><ol><li>Read the sentence calmly. Look for the words that shape it: ‘all’, ‘some’, ‘none’, ‘only’, ‘if…’, ‘and’, ‘or’, ‘not’.</li><li>Give letters to the simple sentences (for example, <em>p</em> = ‘is happy’, <em>q</em> = ‘gets what they desire’) and write down on paper how you think they are related.</li><li>Open ‘Logical form’ and compare. If there is an Euler diagram, each circle is a group of people: ✕ = there is definitely someone there; ? = the sentence does not say whether there is anyone.</li><li>Click ‘See it in the truth table’: the false rows are the cases the sentence rules out. If there are both true rows and false rows, the sentence is <strong>contingent</strong>: it says something about the world, which could have been otherwise.</li><li>Open ‘What it says, what it takes for granted and what it does not say’, and finish with ‘Food for thought’.</li></ol><h3>Watch out for two common traps</h3><ul><li>‘If A, then B’ is not the same as ‘if B, then A’. ‘If it rains, I get wet’ does not say that every time I get wet it is raining.</li><li>‘Only those who are A are B’ does not say that everyone who is A is B. It sets a necessary condition (without A there is no B), not a sufficient one (A is not enough).</li></ul>",
  guiaClasicos: "<h3>What it is for</h3><p>Philosophers argue with very carefully worded sentences, and a word like ‘only’ or ‘if’ completely changes what they are defending. Here, sentences from classic works are analysed with the tools from the other tabs, so you can read the original text more precisely.</p><h3>Step by step</h3><ol><li>First read the group’s introduction: it places you in the work (who is speaking, at what moment and what is being discussed).</li><li>Read the sentence and ask yourself what condition it sets. Is it <strong>necessary</strong> (without it you do not get what is sought) or <strong>sufficient</strong> (with it, that is enough)? Or both?</li><li>Open ‘Logical form’ and look at the Euler diagram and the truth table, as in ‘Exercises’.</li><li>Compare the cards in the same group: sometimes they are variants of the same idea, and a small change in the sentence changes the diagram.</li><li>Finish with ‘Food for thought’ and, if you can, read the full passage in ‘Readings’.</li></ol><p class=\"lg-nota\">At the moment the sentences are from Saint Augustine’s <em>On the Happy Life</em>: who is happy, the one who has what they desire or the one who desires what they cannot lose?</p>"
